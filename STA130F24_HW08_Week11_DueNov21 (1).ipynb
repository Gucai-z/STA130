    "The differences between the two confusion matrices are likely caused by the different feature sets used in the models. In the first matrix, the model uses only the \"List Price\" feature to predict whether a book is hardcover or paperback, which may not capture enough information to make an accurate prediction. In contrast, the second matrix uses a combination of \"NumPages,\" \"Thick,\" and \"List Price\" as features, which likely provides a richer set of information to make predictions, leading to better performance. The two confusion matrices for clf and clf2 above are better because they are tested on the test set (ab_reduced_noNaN_test), which provides a more realistic measure of how the models will perform on unseen data, rather than training data. This helps to avoid overfitting and gives a clearer picture of the models' generalization ability."

Thus overall \"criterion\" noted above improves with each new **decision node splitting rule**, so the improvement can thus be tracked and the improvement contributions attributed to the **feature** upon which the **decision node splitting rule** is based.  This means the relative contribution of each **predictor variable** to the overall explanatory power of the model can be calculated, and this is what the `.feature_importances_` attribute does. \n",

But the so-called **feature importance** heuristics allows us to judge how relatively important the overall contributions from different features are in the final decision tree predictions. Now we just need to be sure we're not **overfitting** our **classification decision trees** since they can be so **complex**. Fortunately, the \"GridSearchCV\" methodology mentioned in regards to finding the best `max_depth` setting for a tree is going to provide a general answer to the challenge of complexity and **overfitting** in **machine learning models** that is not too hard to understand (and which you might already have some guesses or a hunch about). \n",
